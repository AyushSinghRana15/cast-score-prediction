# DeepCSAT: E-commerce Customer Satisfaction Prediction

DeepCSAT is an end-to-end deep learning project aimed at predicting Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores from e-commerce support interactions. The solution leverages historical service data, advanced preprocessing, and an optimized neural network to uncover actionable drivers of customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement

Design an automated system to accurately predict CSAT scores for e-commerce support interactions, helping teams monitor performance and improve service quality using historical data.

## Project Highlights

- Data preprocessing with categorical encoding and feature scaling
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize neural network architecture
- Robust CSAT score prediction using supervised learning
- FastAPI deployment for real-time prediction API
- Interactive dashboard integration (Streamlit/Tkinter) for user-friendly analytics
- Easy integration with modern frontend frameworks

## Usage

1. **Train and Save the Model:**  
   Run the Python scripts to preprocess data, tune model hyperparameters, and save the trained model.
2. **Deploy the API:**  
   Launch the FastAPI server for real-time CSAT predictions.
3. **Dashboard Interface:**  
   Use Streamlit for a simple web interface, or Tkinter for a desktop GUI.
4. **Integration:**  
   Connect your frontend application or data pipeline via API endpoint.

## Technologies

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- FastAPI
- Streamlit / Tkinter
- scikit-learn
- NumPy / Pandas

## Project Summary
